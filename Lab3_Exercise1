/*Write a class called Student with the followings: 
•A String variable called name to store the name of the student;
•A String variable called matricNo to store the matric number of the student; 
•A byte variable called age to store the age of the student;
•A double variable called cgpa to store the cgpa of the student;
•Mutator methods for each member variable;
•A no-argument constructor that assigns empty string to name, matricNo, and zero to age and cgpa;
•A parameterizedconstructor that accept all name, matricNo, age and cgpa as arguments and assign the values to appropriate field;
•A print method with void return type to print out the details of the students.*/
